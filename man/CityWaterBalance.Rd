fraction of et from interception (interc)
amplification factor for runoff (runamp)
fraction of runoff diverted to css (run_css),
fraction of potable water supply lost to leaks (nonrev),

\item{var}{list of time-variant parameter values for:
runoff, as a fraction of precip (roff)}

\item{print}{option to print messages}
}
\value{
list of dataframes for 1) global flows, 2) internal flows, 
       3) storages, 4) global balance, 5) internal balance
       balance, flows and 2) storages
}
\description{
This function tracks the environmental and manmade flows gathered using other
CityWaterBalance functions as they move through pathways and storages
within the urban system.
