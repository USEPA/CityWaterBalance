# CityWaterBalance
`CityWaterBalance` provides a reproducible workflow for studying an urban water
system.  The network of urban water flows and storages can be modeled and 
visualized.  Any city may be modeled with preassembled data, but data for US 
cities can be gathered via web services using this package and dependencies.
