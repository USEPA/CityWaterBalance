`CityWaterBalance` provides a reproducible workflow for studying an urban water
system.  The network of urban water flows and storages can be modeled and 
visualized.  Any city may be modeled with preassembled data, but data for US 
cities can be gathered via web services using this package and dependencies.  

## Install

Development version available on Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("USEPA/CityWaterBalance")
library("CityWaterBalance")
```


## Usage, overview

`CityWaterBalance` is based on a model of the urban water system, or network of
major flows and storages.  This model is codified in a function of the same 
name.

## Usage examples
There are two ways to run the CityWaterBalance model.

### Option 1:  Input preassembled data

See function inputs for details.  Data should be in
self-consistent units.  Each row must represent the same time period.

```
# Specify parameters
p <- list("openwat"=0.02,"interc"=0,"et_amp" = 1,"flow_amp" = 1,"run_amp"=1,
          "run_css"=0.35, "baseflow_amp" = 1, "nonrev"=0.08,"powevap"=0.012,
          "wastgen"=0.85,"potatm"=0.13,"npotinfilt"=0.5,"evslud"=0,
          "css_leak"=0.05,"deepgw"=0.5,"dgwloss"=1)

# Run model
m <- CityWaterBalance(data,p)

# Visualize results
plotWaterBalance(m$global_flows)
plotWaterBalance(m$storages, annual=TRUE) 
```

### Option 2: Input data gathered from web services

The CityWaterBalance package has other functions that can grab and merge the 
requisite data.  At this time, these functions leverage US web services only.

#### Specify spatial and temporal boundaries
To automate this example, geometry already available in the 
[USGS Geo Data Portal](https://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/) (GDP) is used.  A user 
will typically want to upload a zipped shapefile of their urban boundary 
and note the name given to that geometry by the GDP. 

```
geometry <- 'sample:Counties'
att <- 'STATE'
val <- 'RI'
start <- "2015-01-01"
end <- "2015-12-31"
```

#### Get atmospheric data
```
latitude <- 41.878
atm <- getAtmoFlows('2010-01-01','2010-12-31','sample:Counties','STATE','RI',41.824)
```

#### Get streamflow data
