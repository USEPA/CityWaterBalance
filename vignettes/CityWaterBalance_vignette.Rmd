`CityWaterBalance` provides a reproducible workflow for studying urban water
systems.  Any system may be modeled with preassembled data, but data 
for US cities can be gathered via web services using this package and 
dependencies. 


## Install

Development version available on Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("USEPA/CityWaterBalance")
```

```{r}
library("CityWaterBalance")
```

## Usage overview

`CityWaterBalance` is based on a model of the urban water system, shown in the
diagram below.  This diagram specifies the network of water flows along with
a mathematical solution for the changes in water storages (i.e., inflows - 
outflows) within the system.

The function `CityWaterBalance` evaluates the urban system model according to
the numbered flows described in the table below.

## Usage examples
There are two ways to run the `CityWaterBalance` model.

### Option 1:  Input preassembled data

See `CityWaterBalance` function inputs for details on data and parameter inputs.  
Data must be in self-consistent units.  Each row of data must represent the same 
time period. 

The following example is based on the included dataset (`cwb_data`) of flows of 
water in the Chicago metropolitan area.

```{r}
# Specify parameters
p <- list("interc" = 0, "et_mult" = 1, "flow_mult" = 1, "open_wat" = 0.02, "run_mult" = 1, "run_css" = 0.35, "bf_mult" = 1, "nonrev" = 0.08, "pow_evap" = 0.012, "wast_gen" = 0.85, "pot_atm" = 0.13, "npot_infilt" = 0.5, "slud_evap" = 0, "leak_css" = 0.05, "dgw" = 0.5, "dgw_rep" = 0.5)

# Run model
m <- CityWaterBalance(cwb_data, p, print = FALSE)
```

Output from the model includes a list of 5 zoo series with values at each 
timestep for: 1) global flows, 2) internal flows, 3) state variables (storages,
producers and consumers), 4) internal and 5) global water balances.

```{r}
# Visualize output
plotWaterBalance(m$global_flows)
```

### Option 2: Input data gathered from web services

`CityWaterBalance` has other functions that assemble data for the model.  At 
this time, these functions access US-based web services.

#### Specify spatial and temporal boundaries

Define an Area Of Interest (AOI) and upload that geometry to the 
[USGS Geo Data Portal](https://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/) (GDP). The GDP will give the
geometry a name, which may start with 'upload:'.  Here we use a geometry that is 
already available on the GDP in order to automate the example.

```
geometry <- 'sample:Counties'
att <- 'STATE'
val <- 'RI'
area <- 2707
start <- "2010-01-01"
end <- "2010-12-31"
```

#### Get atmospheric data

```
latitude <- 41.5801
atm <- getAtmoFlows(start, end, geometry, att, val, latitude)
```

#### Get streamflow data

Choose streamgages to evaluate total inflow and outflow for the AOI.  
[NWIS mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/) may be useful here.

```
ingages <- c("01112500")
outgages <-c("01113895", "01114000", "01117000", "01118500")

inflow <- getStreamflow(start, end, ingages)
outflow <- getStreamflow(start, end, outgages)
```

Look at the streamflow data with the function `plotStreamflow`.  Gaps can be 
filled using `gapfillStreamflow`.  When time series for all gages are complete, 
use `combineStreamflow` to aggegate total in/outflow.

#### Get water use data

Identify the states and counties in your AOI. County is the finest spatial scale 
for [USGS water use data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/wu) served by NWIS.

```
states <- c("RI")
counties <- list(c("Providence", "Kent", "Bristol", "Newport", "Washington"))
wu <- getWaterUse(states, counties, years = "ALL")
```

The above retrieves [USGS water use](https://water.usgs.gov/watuse/) data for 
the specified counties for all available years and withdrawal categories. To 
reorganize the output for use by `CityWaterBalance` use:

```
wu <- combineWaterUse(start, end, wu)
```

#### Get other data

Not all input data is currently available via web services.  These
inputs (i.e., wastewater effluent, sewer overflows, runoff, baseflow and deep 
groundwater recharge) must be gathered from other sources and converted to xts 
objects with the same temporal range and resolution as the other flows. Units 
must correspond with those specified for inputs to `mergeData`.

Finally, merge the data into a single xts of fluxes (i.e., flow/AOI) for input 
to `CityWaterBalance`.  

```
data <- mergeData(area, atm, inflow, outflow, wu)
```

### Solve

`CityWaterBalance` solves for the changes in storage of system components. 
Acceptable solutions can be determined using ancillary observations (e.g., 
groundwater levels). Owing to uncertainty in input data, parameters, and 
ancillary observations of system storages, acceptable solutions will vary within 
a solution space.  

Solutions with this space may be discovered, and the sensitivity of modeled flow 
explored, with the function `getSolutions`.  `getSolutions` tests for parameter
sets that satisfy criteria for the changes in all system storages. It will 
continue testing additional parameter sets until the mean flow solution differs 
by less than a user-specified tolerance (tol). Although the `CityWaterBalance` 
model runs quickly, running it many times to achieve a stable solution may take 
quite a while.

The following example shows how to search for model solutions that satisfy a
criteria for storage in the combined sewer system again using `cwb_data`.  In 
this dataset, the combined sewer overflow (cso) does not span the complete 
analysis period.  To compensate, the cso flow is set to zero and the acceptable 
range for the Combined Source Sink (css) balance is set to the mean and median of the original data. 
Other criteria are left at default values. The example tol is set high so the example will run in a reasonable amount of time. 

The boxplot call illustrates one way that results may be visualized.

```
data <- cwb_data
data$cso <- 0

p <- list("interc" = 0, "et_mult" = 1, "flow_mult" = 1, "open_wat" = 0.02, "run_mult" = 1, "run_css" = 0.35, "bf_mult" = 1, "nonrev" = 0.08,"pow_evap" = 0.012, "wast_gen" = 0.85, "pot_atm" = 0.13, "npot_infilt" = 0.5, "slud_evap" = 0, "leak_css" = 0.05, "dgw" = 0.5,"dgw_rep" = 0.5)

low <- median(cwb_data$cso,na.rm=TRUE)*nrow(cwb_data)
high <- mean(cwb_data$cso,na.rm=TRUE)*nrow(cwb_data)
css_crit <- c(low,high)

out <- getSolutions(data,p,100,0.02,css_bal = css_crit)
boxplot(out[,order(colMeans(out),decreasing=TRUE)],las = 2, 
ylab = "flow/precipitation", ylim = c(0,1),col = c("lightblue1"), 
border = c("royalblue3"))

```
